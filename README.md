# CMPG-323-Project-3_34221700

# Project Overview
This project involves enhancing and improving an existing Web Application that manages CRUD functionality for project and client data. As a developer, I am  expected to focus on the reading and understanding of code while also enhancing the application through the implementation of architectural patterns, coding principles, and design patterns.

# The core functionality of the system includes:

# Project Management:
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing project data such as ProjectId, ProjectName, ProjectDescription, ProjectCreationDate, ProjectStatus, ClientId.
# Client Management:
CRUD operations for managing client information such as ClientId, ClientName, PrimaryContactEmail, DateOnboarded.

# Non-Functional Requirements
In addition to functional requirements, the project adheres to best practices in software development, which include:

*Security: Ensuring that no sensitive credentials are exposed within the codebase and that data is securely stored.
*Scalability: The system is built to scale with increased usage without sacrificing performance.
*Maintainability: The use of design patterns like the Repository Pattern ensures that the system can be easily maintained and extended.

# Technologies Used
.NET Core MVC: The web framework used to build the application.
Entity Framework Core: For data access and management of database operations.
Azure SQL Database: The database for storing project and client data, hosted on Azure.
Git & GitHub: Version control and project repository hosting.
Azure App Service: Cloud hosting for the deployed application.
